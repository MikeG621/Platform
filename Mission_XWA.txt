This is going to be a very lengthy definition of the XWA mission file. If you
see portions of this write-up that look similar to the TIE95 write-up, that's
because they're probably word-for-word.

The file itself is made of up multiple sections, for the purpose of this file
descriptions each section will will begin at '0', such that to find an offset
in a later section you simply add the total length of the sections before it to
get there. This is what I use in my personal notes, so this is what I am
forcing upon you. I win. I'll try to keep the mission design comments to a
minimum, but I promise nothing.

[[you may notice that as I get into the further section details I'm a little
briefer than usual, that's because I lost some of it in a crash and didn't
feel like expanding it out all the way again]]
=====
XWA Mission Overview

The mission files are found in the \MISSION directory, have the .TIE file
extension, but require the naming convention seen in LEC missions. XWA throws
a fit it you attempt to name it anything other than 1B#M#*.tie. # is the
battle number the mission is in with the second being the mission number, and *
is just that, the * wildcard. Put anything you want there, XWA doesn't give a
damn at that point.

There are already a couple editors out there for XWA missions, most notably
AlliEd. Anyone with a lot of spare time and a hex editor can map out these
values, and whadya know, I was bored :P

=====
XWA Mission Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
BOOL	1	0=false, 1=true
BYTE	1	unsigned 8-bit
SBYTE	1	signed 8-bit, [-128, +127]
CHAR	1	ASCII character
SHORT	2	signed Int16
INT	4	signed Int32
STR(*)	*	null-terminated string, * is a decimal number

NOTE: Any byte locations that are between defined values and are not explicitly
defined are deemed as Reserved(0), and have only been found to have zero
values. Unknown bytes that have non-zero values have been called out in the
structure. Rest assured you have everything here to piece together a mission
file from scratch, but please note offsets if creating read/write procedures.

NOTE2: Since XWA is a step up from XvT, the mission file is larger and even
more complex. There are many sections that are repeated, and several
additional sections that are introduced, some of which being dynamic in size.
You'll see the appropriate notes as needed.

XWA Mission Detail

Hopefully I named the variables descriptive enough for you that you can figure
out what they mean, but I'm going to delve into each section anyway.
Supplementary definitions and lists follow after the detail.

-- FileHeader --

Much like TIE95, the first 6 bytes are well-defined.  After that follow the IFF
names and the Region names, which is new in XWA.

GlobalCargo is something I stumbled upon when I was using the New Horizons
editor, before I started using AlliED. NH uses these values for the craft's
normal Cargo values, not using the one in the flight group's definition. I
only recently figured a lot of this out, this is brand new stuff. The Unknown
values contained therein I don't have nailed down yet, but these cargoes can
be assigned to multiple flight groups, and there is even a TrigVar/Target Type
that can be used similar to GG and GU triggers. A more detailed explanation
belongs in a mission design writeup instead of here.

After these come the Global Group strings (with an odd size of 87), which will
show the name instead of listing out all of the craft as in previous games.
Then we have Hangar, which determines how the mission starts.

We get our Time limit value, the BOOL value forces the mission to end once all
primary goals are completed, BriefingOfficer decides voice-overs within the
briefing room, the BriefingLogo is what shows up on the first screen of the
briefing with the craft list, and then there's a few more Unknowns for good
measure. Unknown4 is labeled as "BriefingLogo2?" in AlliED, and Unknown5
could be listed as number 3, but as to date I haven't seen any sort of effect
from these values. I have seen evidence elsewhere of the file format being
changed partway through development, these last two could be a result of the
official structure being changed during devlopment.

-- FlightGroup --

The first string should be obvious. The Designation stored is a single byte
and two designations can be set. The EnableDesgination values are non-standard
with ENABLED = 0 and DISABLED = 0xFF (-1).

The next two values determine use of GlobalCargo. As is implied by the
variable names (I hope), the first value assigns a GC to the flight group,
and is what you'd see in the mission instead of whatever the usual CARGO is.
The next value is the same, but for the craft's SPECIAL_CARGO. If no GC is
to be used, the value is 0xFF (-1). There's some interesting GC interactions,
but again that belongs in a mission design guide.

A lot of unknown space, and we get to both Cargo strings and the
CraftRole. It is unknown if the string itself drives something within
the game, or if it's just a display. I'm not even sure where it displays. Could
be a hold-over from XvT.

Now we're back to traditional values with a bunch of familiar values you've
seen in the other platforms.  Radio operates in XWA much like XvT, in that
instead of a binary switch the value can be set to any team or player, 1-8.

Formation is obvious, but I'll explain the next couple. FormationSpacing is
the spacing between the craft. GlobalGroup is a great way grouping (gasp)
craft primarily for order and trigger use. Instead of listing out each FG
or craft type in a order you can lump everything to a GG and use a single
target. LeaderSpacing is how far ahead of the rest of the flight group the
flight leader is. Having a flight leader way out front can absorb fire and let
the rest of the group fire salvos before being attacked themselves.  

NumberOfWaves is zero-indexed, but the number you'll likely see in editors is
the number of total waves. A few values have been inserted here, the first
being PlayerNumber. One-indexed, with zero meaning AI-controlled. Next is
ArriveOnlyIfHuman which is a boolean value that as its name suggests, when
active will prevent a Flight Group from appearing in the mission if there isn't
a human pilot behind the controls. PlayerCraft works the same as TIE, with
00 being the default and 01 starting at position 2. Yaw, Pitch and Roll values
work for all craft in XWA, not just objects.

Another obvious value, then the Arrival Triggers. In sentence form, Triggers
are "if Amount of VariableType Variable are Condition, then true". The Arrival
and Departure triggers are just that. The Alternate triggers are there for if
the originals can't be satisfied (mothership isn't in play). *Or* booleans are
evaluated as And=false, Or=true. For the case of Triggers, determines if one or
both Triggers must be completed to evaluate to true. The 12Or34 value likewise
detmines if both trigger pairs must evaluate to true or not. The ArrivalDelay
countdown starts after the full Trigger has been fired, same for the
DepartureDelay values. The AbortTrigger value applies only to individual craft,
not the entire flight group. The Arrive/DepartViaMothership values when false
will cause craft to use hyperspace. The only addition to XWA triggers are the
Parameter values. Parameter is use for region-specific triggers, proximity
triggers and a couple others. Parameter2 is used in few cases but adds just one
more control to the trigger.

Orders, they're what make the world go 'round. Pick the Order from the list
and go from there. The Throttle value has been simplified from XvT, in that it
is evaluated as (Throttle% / 10). The Variables are controlled by the order
itself, as different orders take different amounts for different reasons.
Target# and Target#Type are the same as a Trigger's Variable and VariableType.
Seen in XvT is the Speed value which can override the simple Throttle method
and set Flight Group's speed in MGLT. Helpful for convoys of differing craft.
The value stored is not actually the MGLT value, but a fairly close
approximation of MGLT / 2.2235 (I say fairly close because that's what I
tweaked the multipler to get no difference up to index 100).

XWA stores the Waypoints in the orders themselves, so each order in each region
has a different WP set to allow further control and realism in the mission.
There are 4 Orders and 4 Regions, so the Order array goes from R1O1, R1O2,
R1O3, R1O4, R2O1...

Expanding upon XvT, XWA also has Skip triggers for every order. If this
trigger fires the FG will immediately jump to the appropriate order. The array
is ordered i the same manner as the Orders, going through each order in each
region.

Goals are for that specific flight group. In XWA you have 8 for a given FG,
and all can be given point values, stored as (Points / 25), yielding a range of
[-3200, +3175].  XWA has the Argument value which can be one of these:
00	must
01	must NOT
02	BONUS must
03	BONUS must NOT
In addition the Team can be set, as well as the ActiveSequence value, which is
best described in a mission tutorial. NOTE: in AlliED there is a box for
another number next to the "Use?" checkbox; that box points to the byte
directly before the Parameter value, but every LA mission is just 00 in that
location.  For that reason I do not have it defined explicitly.

The Team values lets you assign to which team the goals apply, and the Enabled
is just another boolean on/off switch. There are plenty of unknown spaces in
the goals section, but this isn't something I've played with yet. For the love
of God/Allah/FSM use these goals instead of Global Goals if possible.

The remaining Waypts are pretty self-explanatory; three start points and HYP
are available here. The Enable value just tells the application if it needs to
pay attention to it or not and is boolean. Region determines which region
the point applies to. If more than one StartPoint is enabled, the application
will pick one to use. Note that there are no briefing points in XWA, that's
because XWA finally uses a true animated briefing. More on that later.

A lot of unknown values, a switch to activate the GlobalUnit value, and the
long list of extra settings first seen in XvT.  Starting off with the
Countermeasures, this is a very short list of
00	None
01	Chaff
02	Flare

CraftExplosionTime acts strangely, and I haven't pinned it down exactly yet.
It does affect how long it takes for a dying craft to dissappear, but seems to
act differently with different ship classes and there is an unknown multipler
from the stored value to seconds.

Another Status value for you to use, followed by GlobalUnit. Similar to GG,
GU can take multiple Flight Groups and assign them a single number for easy
triggers and targets. Another use is to share numbering, good for multiple
definitions of a flight group, this keeps the numbering consistent between
them. Flight Groups do not need the same name to share numbering.

The Optional values are the alternate loadouts that the player can select when
going over his craft. As you can see you can list the majority of items and
several craft at any given time. The Category value allows you to easily
select a given ship list.
00	None
01	All Flyable
02	All Rebel Flyable
03	All Imperial Flyable
04	User Defined

Pilot has no real effect in XWA, but is most often used for a note as to which
voice is used for the FG's messages. Just a bookkeeping value, can be ignored.

-- Backdrops --

Backdrops (stars, planets, etc) are special types of flight groups. Value
definitions change for these purposes, which will be laid out here. For
starters, Name becomes LightRGB, where the color values are 0.0-1.0 so a
white light will be "1.0 1.0 1.0" and no light would be "0.0 0.0 0.0".

The GlobalCargoIndex number is used as the Shadow.  Note however, that not
every backdrop uses this exact list, some remove items and renumber
accordingly.  Start with this list and work from there if you notice it
doesn't match up.
FF	None
00	Right 3/4
01	Right Half
02	Right Quarter
03	Left Quarter
04	Left Half
05	Left 3/4
06	???

Cargo is instead the Brightness, which also uses a numeric value of increasing
intensity. "1.0" is the default.

SpecialCargo is the size of the object, to be used for backdrops and not so
much pure light sources.  Also a numeric value.

The Backdrop value is used here, and this defines the image that is used.  If
the value is zero, then it is just a light source.

Due to how XWA places backdrops within the game, the start location CANNOT be
0, 0, 0.  Allied and YOGEME both check for this as it will crash the game.

-- Message --

A simple section, nothing really tricky here.  The Voice appears to simply
be a note on the voice itself (RP1, Wedge, etc), and Color is the following:
00	Green
01	Red
02	Blue
03	Yellow
04	Red
05	Purple

OriginatingFG is a value I noticed looking over LA missions. This value is
used as the Flight Group that the message is coming from. Zero-indexed, and 
since the player craft is usually the first ship in the craft listing, a value
of zero implies it's coming from your ship, a value of 1 is from the next ship,
etc. Not every LA mission uses it, and there doesn't appear to be any game
mechanic behind it, as a message from a given ship will still fire even if that
ship is destroyed. This the "Unk" value in the lower-right in AlliED. Just
looks like another bookkeeping value.

New to XWA is yet another function to add realism, is the Cancel trigger.  If
this trigger fires before the message can, the message will not fire regardless
if the trigger is ever met or not, so a message won't come from a destroyed
vessel, for example.

-- GlobalGoal --

When FG goals just won't cut it, that's what there are for. What is there is
self-explanatory by now. Triggers and the #Or# with ActiveSequence. Yay. The
GoalGlobal array is comprised of the Primary, Prevent and Secondary (Bonus)
goals in that order. This Section is repeated 10 times, once for each team.

-- Team --

This section also repeats 10 times, once for each team. In here we have
obviously the Name, allies and the mission goal messages. The strings at
the end are the usual Voice notes, and there's some Unknowns to boot.
Allegiance can have the following values:
00	Hostile
01	Friendly
02	Neutral

EndOfMissionMessages are 64 character strings, not terminated. It's really a
[64][3,2] array, as the strings are PrimaryComplete1, PrimaryComplete2,
PrimaryFailed1, PrimaryFailed2, Outstanding1, Oustanding2.

-- Briefing --

Okay, we finally get to the briefing. The command listing itself I'll leave
for the list definition, that'll also have the variable listing as well. The
first value is the duration of the briefing itself in ticks. XWA uses 0x19
ticks per second.

Each Event is marked by the briefing time (in ticks) and the EventType,
followed by 0-4 additional variables. These variables are to be omitted if
they are not used for a given command. The last four active bytes in the Event
array is always 0F 27 22 00, which is the EndBriefing command at time 9999, and
usually isn't the last four bytes in the section (that would be a rather busy
briefing).

The StartsLength value is the number of SHORTs, Variables included, that occur
at Time=0. EventsLength is the total number of SHORTs occupied in the Events
array up to and including the EndBriefing command.

The Tag and String arrays are not fixed sizes. They have a minimum length of
256 bytes, which is the case of every length being zero. If a Length is zero,
then the CHAR[] is omitted. That's the real highlight right there.

-- EditorNotes --

There's really nothing to speak of here. It's a long string used only in the
editor.

-- MessageNotes --

64 strings, all 100CHAR null-termed. Doesn't seem to be much else to it. These
were used as notes for the voice actors.

-- DescriptionNotes --

Appears to be the exact same thing as MessageNotes, but instead applying to
the Description strings in the order Successful, Description and Failed.

-- FGGoalStrings --

Simple, fast, and the majority of the time empty. Instead of using the default
strings on the goal listing you can define your own here. This section is
dynamic in size, with * being 1 if 00, 64 otherwise. 

The array structure is 3 strings per goal, 8 goals per FG. Incomplete, Complete
and Failed in that order.

-- GlobalGoalStrings --

For the most part, the same as Section 11. Define your own strings, this
section is always here in the same dynamic manner and repeats 10 times, once
for each team. As before * is 1 if 00, 64 otherwise.

The array structure here is 3 strings per Trigger, 4 Triggers per goal, 3 goals
per Team. Strings are Incomplete, Complete and Failed in that order. Goals are
Primary, Prevent and Secondary (Bonus) in that order.

Prevent Failed is always 00. Secondary Incomplete and Failed are always 00.

-- OrderStrings --

XWA also allows custom strings for craft orders that are displayed in the CMD
and in-flight craft listings. Array appears to be sized for 192 craft, even
though that's beyond the mission limits. As in the previous sections, * is 1 if
00, 64 otherwise.

Array follows same pattern as Orders; R1O1, R1O2...

-- Descriptions --

It's a few really long strings, Successful, Failed and Mission Description in
that order.

There you have it, the XWA Mission file format. Enjoy :P
