This is going to be a very lengthy definition of the XvT mission file. Due
to the size of the files we'll be dealing with, I'll be using the extended
structure write-up first seen in the TIE95 Mission File definition. If you see
portions of this write-up that look similar to the TIE95 write-up, that's
because they're probably word-for-word.

The file itself is made of up multiple sections, equatable to a single resource
in a LFD with multiple subheaders. For the purpose of these file descriptions,
each section will will begin at '0', such that to find an offset in a later
section, you simply add the total length of the sections before it to get
there. This is what I use in my personal notes, so this is what I am forcing
upon you. I win. I'll try to keep the mission design comments to a minimum,
but I promise nothing.

=====
XvT Mission Overview

The mission files are found in the \TRAIN directory, have the .TIE file
extension and no required naming convention, just that the appropriate .LST
has the filename spelled correctly to be able to play it. The LEC naming
convention for the files is a little more involved than in TIE95 and varies
depending on the type of mission you're creating. Since the naming convention
doesn't have any effect on playing the mission, I'm going to skip over this.

There are already a couple editors out there for XvT missions, most notably
XvTEd. Anyone with a lot of spare time and a hex editor can map out these
values, and whadya know, I was bored :P

=====
XvT Mission Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
BOOL	1	0=false, 1=true
BYTE	1	unsigned 8-bit
SBYTE	1	signed 8-bit, [-128, +127]
CHAR	1	ASCII character
SHORT	2	signed Int16
DWORD	4	signed Int32
STR(*)	*	null-terminated string, * is an integer

NOTE: Any byte locations that are between defined values and are not explicitly
defined are deemed as Reserved(0), and have only been found to have zero
values. Unknown bytes that have non-zero values have been called out in the
structure. Rest assured you have everything here to piece together a mission
file from scratch, but please note offsets if creating read/write procedures.

NOTE2: Since XvT is a step up from TIE95, the mission file is larger and more
complex.  There are many sections that are repeated, and several additional
sections that are introduced, some of which being dynamic in size.  You'll see
the appropriate notes as needed.

=====
XvT Mission Detail

Hopefully I named the variables descriptive enough for you that you can figure
out what they mean, but I'm going to delve into each section anyway.
Supplementary definitions and lists follow after the detail.

-- FileHeader --

Much like TIE95, the first 6 bytes are well-defined. The PlatformID byte can be
one of two values.
12	XvT
14	BoP
The only known difference between platforms is seen at the very end, and a few
more Unknown values

RndSeed is an initializer to the pseudo-random number generator, for the
purpose of randomizing backdrops and asteroid spawns. It helps ensure that
these features are synchronized in multiplayer. 

IffNames is a list of four custom strings for IFF #3 to 6. It is used
exclusively for displaying IFF global goals in the in-game goal overlay. The
first two IFF names (Rebel, Imperial) are accessed directly from localized
strings found in "strings.txt" and cannot be modified in this list. If the
first character of a string is "1", that first character is ignored.

The MissionType value defines the mission as either a Training (normal) mission
or a combat mission.
00	Training
01	Unknown
02	Melee
03	Multiplayer Training
04	Multiplayer Combat

The unknown mission type seems to be some kind of prototype melee. End mission
combat statistics are not recorded in the pilot file. There may be other
differences too.

GoalsUnimportant indicates that a mission outcome can never be resolved.
Neither failure or victory is possible. Typically used for melee scenarios
where accumulation of points is all that matters.

Following that are the TimeLimit values, and a seemingly bunch of blank space.

-- FlightGroup --

The first string is obvious. The Pilot string from TIE95 has been removed, and
instead there's a new section for craft roles. This is where the specialized
messages are controlled. The full listing will be below. Roles can only be
set for Imperials, Rebels, Team 3 and Team 4. It is also possible to set a
role for all teams. The Designation stored is only the first three letters of
the full item. The Team is a CHAR and uses the DesignationTeam enum.

It is unknown if the remaining teams can have roles, but they have been seen
in LEC-produced missions. An alternate usage seen in LEC missions is defining
an AI level across both the Team and Designation fields, instead using this
area as a different string value. The effect of this is unknown, as the strings
seen don't match the craft's, but it's possible that it may instead give the
Designation to a team, it may give it to a certain AI level. It may also be
garbage info and not do anything.

Now we're back to traditional values, with both Cargo strings, and a bunch of
familiar values you've seen in TIE95. The only item inserted here is Team,
which should be easy enough to figure out. Radio operates differently
in XvT. Instead of a binary switch, the value can be set to any team or
player, 1-8. The full listing is defined later.

Formation is obvious, but I'll explain the next couple. FormationSpacing is
the spacing between the craft. GlobalGroup is a great way grouping (gasp)
craft primarily for order and trigger use. Instead of listing out each FG
or craft type in a order you can lump everything to a GG and use a single
target. LeaderSpacing is how far ahead of the rest of the flight group the
flight leader is. Having a flight leader way out front can absorb fire and let
the rest of the group fire salvos before being attacked themselves.  

Formation has no effect on mines. They use the Status1 field instead. Possible
values are:
0: Floor (X-Y plane)
1: Side (Y-Z plane)
2: Front (X-Z plane)
3: All overlap a single point. They'll destroy each other with friendly-fire.
Anything beyond repeats this sequence. There is no way to change the spacing.

NumberOfWaves is zero-indexed, but the number you'll likely see in editors is
the number of total waves. A few values have been inserted here, the first
being PlayerNumber. One-indexed, with zero meaning AI-controlled. Next is
ArriveOnlyIfHuman, which is a boolean value that as its name suggests, when
active will prevent a Flight Group from appearing in the mission if there isn't
a human pilot behind the controls. PlayerCraft works the same as TIE, with
00 being the default and 01 starting at position 2.

StopArrivingWhen is a previously unknown value. It is a special condition that
that is checked any time a new wave is supposed to spawn. If the condition is
met, the wave will not spawn, and all remaining waves will be flagged as having
come and gone. There are 4 possible values. See the enum listing.

Yaw, Pitch and Roll values only work for Space Objects (mines, buoys, etc), and
like TIE the flight engine automaticlly adds a -90° (nose down) pitch angle.

Another obvious value, then the Arrival Triggers. In sentence form, Triggers
are "if Amount of VariableType Variable are Condition, then true". The Arrival
and Departure triggers are just that. The Alternate triggers are there for if
the originals can't be satisfied (mothership isn't in play). *Or* booleans are
evaluated as And=false, Or=true. For the case of Triggers, determines if one or
both Triggers must be completed to evaluate to true. The 12Or34 value likewise
detmines if both trigger pairs must evaluate to true or not. The ARR_DELAY
works as expected, with the countdown starting after the Trigger has been
fired. The DEP_DELAY changed from TIE, in that it now too starts the countdown
from the firing of the Trigger. The AbortTrigger value applies only to
individual craft, not the entire flight group. The Arrive/DepartViaMothership
values when false will cause craft to use hyperspace.

Two obscure values, RandomArrivalDelayExtraMinutes and Seconds control extra
delay time that stacks additively with the ordinary arrival delay once the
trigger is activated. The extra delay is calculated as seconds. If Randomize
is enabled in the mission options, the extra delay will be anything from zero
to the specified extra delay. If Randomize is disabled, it will always choose
half the total delay.

Orders, they're what make the world go 'round. Pick the Order from the list
and go from there. Throttle is expressed as (10 - %Throttle / 10). So 100%
Throttle would be 00, 90% would be 01, 80% would be 02, etc. The Variables are
controlled by the order itself, as different orders take different amounts for
different reasons. Target# and Target#Type are the same as a Trigger's Variable
and VariableType. The Speed value can override the simple Throttle method
and set Flight Group's speed in MGLT. Helpful for convoys of differing craft.
The value stored is not actually the MGLT value, but a fairly close
approximation of MGLT / 2.2235 (I say fairly close because that's what I
tweaked the multipler to get no difference up to index 100). The Designation
string is a note that will show in the CMD as the craft's orders when you
target it.

XvT also gives us the first attempt at a dynamic mission with the
SkipToOrder4 triggers. As you can guess, if this trigger fires the FG will
immediately jump to their Order[3]. There is a number of uses for this, but
that's best saved for a mission creation guide.

Goals are for that specific flight group. In XvT you have 8 for a given FG,
and all can be given point values, stored as (Points / 250), yielding a range
of [-32000, +31750]. A new value in XvT is the Argument, which is defined as
00	must
01	must NOT
02	BONUS must
03	BONUS must NOT

The Team values lets you assign to which team the goals apply, and the Enabled
is just another boolean on/off switch.  One of the Unkonwns in the goal may be
time related, as XvTEd has a "Time?" box, but this isn't something I've played
with yet. For the love of God use these goals instead of Global Goals if
possible.

Waypoints are pretty simple, the array is X, Y, Z and Enabled in that order.
The values are expressed as (Coordinate * 160), such that a value of 50 is
0.50km, A0 is 1.00km, etc. The Enable value just tells the application if it
needs to pay attention to it or not and is boolean, although it does occupy a
SHORT. If more than one StartPoint is enabled, the application will pick one to
use. Note that there are 8 different briefing WPs you can use, one for each.

Now here is where the bulk of the new material has been placed.
PreventCraftNumbering is a bool.  If enabled, multiple craft in a wave (or global
unit) will not have craft numbering.  (For example, Alpha instead of Alpha 1,
Alpha 2, etc.)

DepartureClockMinutes and DepartureClockSeconds are previously unknown values
that appear to control an absolute departure time based on the total elapsed
time from the start of the mission, rather than the trigger activation.
If the time has been met or exceeded, the flight group will withdraw.

Countermeasures, this is a very short list of
00	None
01	Chaff
02	Flare
03  Cluster Mine (unused/extra type, behaves like a flare)

CraftExplosionTime acts strangely, and I haven't pinned it down exactly yet.
It does affect how long it takes for a dying craft to dissappear, but seems to
act differently with different ship classes and there is an unknown multipler
from the stored value to seconds.

Another Status value for you to use, followed by GlobalUnit. Similar to GG,
GU can take multiple Flight Groups and assign them a single number for easy
triggers and targets. Another use is to share craft numbering.

The Optional values are the alternate loadouts that the player can select when
going over his craft. As you can see you can list the majority of items and
several craft at any given time. The Category value allows you to easily
select a given ship list.
00	None
01	All Flyable
02	All Rebel Flyable
03	All Imperial Flyable
04	User Defined

-- Section 2a - Backdrops --
Backdrops (stars, planets, etc) are special types of flight groups. Value
definitions change for these purposes, which will be laid out here.

The primary value here is Status1, which becomes the Backdrop value. This
determines the graphic used. The majority of other values are ignored.

-- Message --

A simple section, there is the message string, the SendTo* array, the triggers,
a delay, and the *Or* value.  The EditorNote serves no purpose within the game
itself, and is merely there for bookkeeping use in the editor. The only special
item of note is that the Delay value is evaluated to (seconds / 5), such that
01 is 5s, 03 is 15s, etc.

The message string actually holds a second purpose, that is defining the color
of the message itself. The default message color is red, if the message starts
with '1' it is green, '2' is blue and '3' is yellow. The number will not appear
when displayed in-game.

Technical note: the game will allow the full 64 characters to be used without
any negative side effects. The final character is not required to be a null
terminator. It will overflow into the SendTo* array, but most of it is null
anyway, or is a non-printable char. Even so there's a hard limit of 70 chars
that are copied into the actual message log.

The Delay is multipled by 5 to get the number of seconds, resulting in a
maximum delay of 1275s or 21:15.

-- GlobalGoal --

When FG goals just won't cut it, that's what there are for. Nothing really new
here, Points is the same as GoalFG.Points. The array is Primary, Prevent and
Secondary in that order. This Section is repeated 10 times, once for each team.

-- Team --

This section also repeats 10 times, once for each team. In here we have
obviously the Name, its alliances (boolean values), and the mission goal
messages. There's enough blank space at the end of the section for another
string, but as far as I know it's never used.  The goal messages also follow
the same color behaviour as in-flight messages.

EndOfMissionMessages are 64 character strings, not terminated. It's really a
[64][3,2] array, as the strings are PrimaryComplete1, PrimaryComplete2,
PrimaryFailed1, PrimaryFailed2, SecondaryComplete1, SecondaryComplete2.

-- Briefing --

Okay, we finally get to the briefing. The command listing itself I'll leave
for the list definition, that'll also have the variable listing as well. The
first value is the duration of the briefing itself in ticks. XvT uses 0x14
ticks per second.

Each Event is marked by the briefing time (in ticks) and the EventType,
followed by 0-4 additional variables. These variables are to be omitted if
they are not used for a given command. The last four active bytes in the Event
array is always 0F 27 22 00, which is the EndBriefing command at time 9999, and
usually isn't the last four bytes in the section (that would be a rather busy
briefing).

The StartsLength value is the number of SHORTs, Variables included, that occur
at Time=0. EventsLength is the total number of SHORTs occupied in the Events
array up to and including the EndBriefing command.

The Tag and String arrays are not fixed sizes. They have a minimum length of
64 bytes, which is the case of every length being zero. If a Length is zero,
then the CHAR[] is omitted. That's the real highlight right there.

Technical note: Attempting to render a text tag with a string character
length >= 40 will crash the game.

-- FGGoalStrings --

Simple, fast, and the majority of the time empty. Instead of using the default
strings on the goal listing you can define your own here. This section is a
fixed size, and occurs once for each Flight Group.

The array structure is 3 strings per goal, 8 goals per FG. Incomplete, Complete
and Failed in that order.

-- GlobalGoalString --

For the most part, the same as FGGoalStrings. Define your own strings, this
section is always here with a fixed size and repeats 10 times, once for each
team. 

The array structure here is 3 strings per Trigger, 4 Triggers per goal, 3 goals
per Team. Strings are Incomplete, Complete and Failed in that order. Goals are
Primary, Prevent and Secondary in that order. So it starts with PrimT1Inc, then
PrimT1Comp and PrimT1Fail before moving to PrimT2Inc, etc.

Prevent Failed is always empty. Secondary Incomplete and Failed are always
empty.

There's a bunch of empty space, so even though the strings themselves take up
0x900, there's another 0xC00 to skip over.

-- MissionDescription --

As noted in the structure listing, this section differs depending on platform.
It's a really long string(s), it's so hard. For BoP, the array is
SuccessfulDebrief, FailedDebrief, MissionDescription in that order.

There you have it, the XvT Mission file format. Enjoy :P

Notes:
0x05 and 0x0E (both No Turrets) will deactivate all gun turrets on a ship.
Fixed forward-firing cannons are unaffected. 0x0E goes further, disabling the
scripts that are responsible for managing turret behavior. Could possibly save
CPU cycles, but both are otherwise identical from a gameplay perspective.

0x15 (Infinite Ammo) applies to cannon energy, warheads, and countermeasures.

Other duplicates are just that, essentially aliases that do the same thing.
The unknowns don't seem to be used at all.

Notes:
0x09 (Survived) Checks the number of craft that have survived at the moment the
trigger is evaluated. Includes craft that haven't arrived yet. Excludes craft
that have been destroyed by any means.

0x0D/0x0E (Completed/Failed Primary Goals) and 0x11/0x12 (Completed/Failed
Bonus Goals) If VariableType is Team, it checks the mission outcome for that
team. In all other cases, it is true if any team has achieved victory.
0x0F and 0x10 (Completed/Failed Secondary Goals) don't do anything.

0x18 (Cannon system disabled) is true when the cannons are missing or disabled.
Capital ships don't have a cannon subsystem, so it will always be true for
them. Mag pulse does not damage the cannon subsystem of AI craft, but it will
for players, so it can be used to detect a mag pulse hit on a player craft.

0x19 (Be dropped off) Never seems be be true, either as a trigger or goal.

0x1A (Destroyed in 1 hit) A broken condition. It's supposed to be "come and
go without being attacked" but the implementation is broken in a few ways. For
trigger purposes, when it comes-and-goes, it will still evaluate to true even
if attacked by the player. It is only false if attacked by AI, and only AI.
When used as a goal, being attacked by anything (player or AI) is an anti-
condition and will be immediately detected, resulting in instant failure. But
there's another bug. If the player destroys the craft very quickly ("in 1 hit" 
such as when using warheads), then "come-and-go" takes precendence over
"attacked" and evaluates to success, even though it was attacked. But this bug
only applies if the FG is one craft of one wave.

0x1B (Not be disabled) A "come and go" condition, but is half broken. For
triggers, it will activate even if the craft was disabled. However it does seem
to work correctly as a goal, since being disabled is an anti-condition.

0x1C (Not be captured) A "come and go" condition that actually seems to work
correctly.

0x1D (Come and go w/o Inspection) Not as straightforward as it would seem.
Statistics per team are only tracked if the craft actually arrives, then leaves
or is destroyed. Global statistics are only tracked if the craft comes and goes
by proxy (mothership destroyed prior to launch, or departure ship destroyed
after landing).
If evaluated as a FG goal, or as a trigger paired with Condition 0x27, it uses
the per-team statistic. Otherwise it uses the global statistic.

0x1F (Not being boarded) A "come and go" condition that is tracked if the craft
was never finished being boarded by another craft.

0x21 (Not begin docking) A "come and go" condition that is tracked if the craft
never finished boarding another craft.

0x26 (Always Failed) Evaluates to failure, as opposed to merely false. If used
for a goal, it will cause immediate failure.

0x27 (Inspect/Pickup team modifier) The game tracks Inspection/Pickup
statistics in two ways. The default way is a grand total, which all teams
contribute to. If any one team inspects a neutral, it's considered inspected by
everyone for the purposes of all basic triggers. This modifier lets you check
a specific team, and how much. It can only be used for particular conditions:
Inspection, Come and Go Without Inspection, or Be Picked Up.

Triggers operate in pairs (A:B). This condition is intended to be used in the B
trigger, which modifies the A trigger to access statistics for a specific team
instead the grand total. Trigger B's VariableType must be set to Team. Variable
must be set to the team index. Amount doesn't matter. The and/or boolean
doesn't matter.

FG Goals don't operate in pairs, instead they automatically use the team they
check against. It's basically an implicit team modifier, for the few conditions
that accept them.

0x29 (be all Player Craft) and 0x2A (be all AI Craft) When combined with a
VariableType of IFF or Team, has a special interaction. Instead of counting all
craft, it counts the number of active player slots out of the total number of
playable FGs. This allows mission design to tailor difficulty based on number
of active players.

0x2C (bagged) Similar to capture. The distinction is that capture is logged
instantaneously, but being bagged requires the captured craft to enter hangar
or hyperspace out. If a craft is picked up (such as by a Heavy Lifter), it is
captured by the craft carrying it.

0x2E (be carried away) This is a pick-up condition, but is distinct from bagged
that it can only operate on friendly craft. They must not be captured.

Notes:
0x06 (Order) Only checks the first mission order of the craft, as defined by
its flight group. Not its actual current order.

0x07 (CraftWhen) Any conditions that aren't Player Craft or Non-Player Craft
will always return true when used for triggers. It is mostly intended to be
used for orders.

0x09 (Adjusted AI skill) Typically skill levels are modified by difficulty
setting and game type. This condition checks the resulting adjusted skill
level.

0x0A (Status1) Only checks Status1, not Status2.

0x0E (Before elapsed time) Time values are multiplied by 5 seconds. If the
elapsed time is within this value, a target will be considered. If a target has
been acquired, they won't necessarily stop shooting when the time limit is
reached. This is a unique condition, only working correctly in very specific
situations. See important notes further below.

0x0D (Player Slot) This condition has a bug in the programming which causes it
to work incorrectly if used to target Player #1. If the first FG in the mission
is PlayerNumber 1, it will most likely target all craft, even the AI. It seems
this can be avoided by having Player #1 in any other FG that isn't the first.

0x16 (All Player Slot except) Both of these Player Slot conditions only
consider flight groups of the corresponding player number, and they must have
an active human pilot assigned to their duty roster. If no player is assigned,
they will not be targeted.  If there is a player, it will target all craft in
the FG, including AI wingmen.
These are unique conditions. See notes continued below.

- Unique Conditions -
0x0D (Player slot), 0x0E (Before elapsed time), and 0x16 (All player slot
except) are not valid conditions for triggers and will always return false.
They work for orders, but are uniquely problematic when compared to other
conditions.

Potential order targets are typically scanned using two stages. The first stage
examines flight groups for potentially valid targets, not invididual craft.
Potential targets include flight groups that haven't arrived yet, in which case
the operating craft will patrol until something arrives. Only when such
potential targets are considered, will it proceed to the second stage. Then
invidual craft are scanned to select an actual target.

What makes these three conditions problematic is they are only examined in the
second stage. They always return false in the first stage. Some other
condition, such as a secondary target, must be a valid potential target in
order to proceed to the second stage.

There are ways to trick the game to proceed to the second stage, using other
targets that can be expected to exist, that haven't arrived or logically never
will, or even target its own FG. Each option has downsides such as wasted FG
slots or deadlocked orders.

Notes:
0x01 triggers if the shield subsystem is missing or disabled. Otherwise only
triggers for freighter or starship classes if shields are at zero.

0x02 triggers if the cannon subsystem is missing or disabled. Mag pulse does
not apply. Starships do not have a cannon subsystem and will immediately
abort as soon as they arrive.

AI craft will receive subsystem damage from ions if their system strength is
weak enough, even though it may not actually hinder their ability to use them.
