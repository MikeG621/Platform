Library for editing LucasArts *.XWI and *.TIE mission files for Xwing95, TIE95, XvT and XWA.

## Latest Release
#### v7.2, 09 Mar 2025
- (TIE, XvT) Missions with too many Messages will now load, though the excess will be lost. [[YOGEME#120](https://github.com/MikeG621/YOGEME/issues/120)]
  - Note: Does not apply to XWA due to Messages being valid Trigger inputs, so simply deleting can break the mission.

### Version History

#### v7.1, 02 Feb 2025
- (TIE) "Board to Destroy Cargo" now "Board with no Effect". [[YOGEME#117](https://github.com/MikeG621/YOGEME/issues/117)]
- (XWA) Defect order text now includes IFF. [[YOGEME#113](https://github.com/MikeG621/YOGEME/issues/113)]
- (Strings) MeshType added.
- (XWA) Fixes in the Order Var labels.

#### v7.0, 06 Oct 2024
- Format spec for XWA implemented, includes some backflow into TIE and XvT.
  - This means all XWA Unknowns are defined; many that were left were editor-use only or Unused.
  - Not all editor-use properties are exposed.
  - Various things renamed. ***BREAKING CHANGE***
  - ArrDep mothership properties renamed, the `*Method` bools are now `*ViaMothership` or `*MothershipUsed` per proper boolean naming convention.
- Waypoint refactor. ***BREAKING CHANGE***
  - BaseWaypoint renamed to Waypoint, no longer abstract.
  - Xwa.FlightGroup.Waypoint renamed to XwaWaypoint.
  - Xwing, TIE, and XvT now use Waypoint (formerly BaseWaypoint) directly. Previously derived classes deleted.
  - `Clone()` added.
- (TIE) Added Questions.QuestionType and .QuestionCondition enums, PostTrigger and PostTrigType types changed. ***BREAKING CHANGE***
- (Xwing) GetTIECraftType now returns `byte`.
- (Xwing) ArrDep `*Hyperspace` renamed to `*ViaHyperspace` and changed to `bool`.
- (Xwing) Added `FlightGroup.CommandList` enum
- (Briefing) EventParameters now a singleton class, `this[]` made private in lieu of `GetCount()`. ***BREAKING CHANGE***
- (Briefing) Deleted `EventParameterCount`, since it's redundant with `GetCount()`.
- (Briefing) `ConvertTicksToSeconds` and `ConvertSecondsToTicks` functions added.
- (Briefing) `Events` parameter now a collection new `Event` class objects instead of `short[]`. ***BREAKING CHANGE***
  - This causes many changes throughout. Most of the work is now done within the collection or event itself without
  requiring a lot of array manipulation.
- (TIE-XWA) `BaseFlightGroup.Difficulty` changed to new `Difficulties` enum.
- (Xwing Briefing) Couple internal changes around event conversion.
  - `short[] _eventMapper` now `EventMap[] _eventMaps`.
  - `short getEventMapperIndex()` now `EventMap getEventMapper`.
- (XWA) The TrimEnd fix from v5.0 reapplied and expanded throughout.
