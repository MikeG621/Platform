XWING95 Mission Overview

Mission files are found in the \MISSION and \CLASSIC directories.  Depending on
whether new missions or classic missions are selected in X-wing's options menu,
it will load the mission from one of those directories.

Every mission is composed of two files: the mission file (.XWI extension) and
briefing file (.BRF extension).  Only the mission file is required to play
missions.  If the briefing file is missing, the mission will still function
correctly, but the briefing will be empty.

XWING95 Mission Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
BOOL	1	0=false, 1=true
BYTE	1	unsigned 8-bit
SBYTE	1	signed 8-bit, [-128, +127]
CHAR	1	ASCII character

XWING95 Mission Detail

Hopefully I named the variables descriptive enough for you that you can figure
out what they mean, but I'm going to delve into each section anyway. Section 5
and on will require a bit of explaining anyway. Supplementary definitions and
lists follow after the detail.

-- FileHeader --

The first SHORT is a marker used to identify the mission file as belonging to
XWING95. Other platforms have different markers in this place, but it is
unknown whether the application actually checks this value to determine if the
file is valid or not.

TimeLimitMinutes is the time limit, in minutes.  Pilot Proving Ground courses
do not use this value.

EndEvent (enum) determines what happens when the player dies, and determines
the end trigger for Death Star Surface missions.

RndSeed is supposed to be an initializer to the pseudo-random number generator,
for the purposes of randomizing backdrops. However, it is not actually used by
the game and therefore completely useless. It is zero in all missions.

Location (enum) determines whether mission is in deep space, or Death Star
Surface.

EndOfMissionMessages
Three messages that are displayed in sequence when the mission is complete.

NumFGs, NumOGs
Number of Flight Groups and Object Groups, respectively.  XWING distinguishes
between normal craft and objects.  Objects include mines, probes, satellites,
and backdrops.

-- FlightGroup --

Name, Cargo
These strings appear in the CMD when the craft is selected.

SpecialCargo, SpecialCargoCraft
A single craft in a Flight Group may have cargo that is unique to the rest.
SpecialCargoCraft is zero based.  The first craft in the FG is 0, second is 1,
etc.  To prevent SpecialCargo from being used, SpecialCargoCraft must be a
value outside the number of craft in a FG.  -1 works, or for example a value of
1 if the FG only has a single craft per wave.

CraftType (enum)
Determines which craft.  There is a special case for B-wings.  The B-wing does
not actually have its own CraftType ID, instead it is a Y-wing with a special
status applied.  YOGEME abstracts this away, allowing the user to select B-wing
from the craft list.

IFF (enum)
Determines which IFF the craft will appear as.  XWING is unique in the series
in that it has a "Default" IFF (value=0).  Upon mission load, the craft will be
transformed into its actual IFF depending on CraftType:

X-W, Y-W/B-W, A-W, CRS, FRG        -> Rebel (Green)
T/F, T/I, T/B, GUN, TRN, STD, T/A  -> Imperial (Red)
SHU, TUG, CON, FRT, CRV            -> Neutral (Blue)

Neutral craft are typically ignored as mission targets unless FGs are
explicitly ordered to target them.

Status (enum)
Determines modifiers to the craft.  There is a special case for Y-wings.  If
the status is 10 (decimal) or higher, the FG is interpreted as a B-wing
CraftType instead.  The status list repeats in the same order.  For example, a
Y-Wing with a status of 1 has no warheads, but with a status of 11 becomes a
B-Wing with no warheads.
Note: If a player craft is given a status of half shields, their shield system
will be considered disabled and inoperative.

NumberOfCraft, NumberOfWaves
Determines how many craft are in each wave, and the number of waves.
NumberOfWaves is zero-indexed, so the number stored is actually the number of
additional waves after the inital starting group.

ArrivalEvent (enum)
The arrival event trigger that must be satisfied before a craft will arrive in
the mission.  Typically only at least one craft from a FG must satisfy the
condition.  In the case of "must be destroyed" the rest of the wave(s) must
come and go.

ArrivalDelay
Determines how much time after ArrivalEvent is triggered before the craft will
arrive in the mission.  This value is encoded in an unusual format:
If ArrivalDelay <= 20, the value is interpreted as minutes.
If ArrivalDelay > 20, subtract 20, then multiply the result by 6 seconds.

Examples:
A value of 5 means 5 minutes, 0 seconds.
A value of 21 means 0 minutes, 6 seconds.
A value of 30 means 1 minute.
A value of 32 means 1 minute, 12 seconds.

ArrivalFG
Part of the arrival trigger, determines which FG must satisfy the conditions.
Zero based.  -1 for none.

Mothership
Determines the FG to arrive or depart from.  Zero based.  -1 for none.

ArrivalHyperspace, DepartureHyperspace
These values will be 1 if allowed to use hyperspace, or 0 to use Mothership.
Captured fighters and transports will use the Mothership of the boarding
vessel.  Starships will enter hyperspace.

Waypoint X, Y, Z, Enabled
There are 7 waypoints.  All seven X coordinates are loaded first, then all Y,
all Z, then all Enabled values.

The values are expressed as (Coordinate * 160), such that a value of 0x50 is
0.50km, 0xA0 is 1.00km, etc. The Enable value just tells the game if it needs
to pay attention to it or not and is boolean, although it does occupy a SHORT.

Note: Some orders will only function properly if their waypoints are set.
Note: If more than one StartPoint is enabled, the game will randomly select
which StartPoint to use.  In some cases it will randomize start points EVEN IF
the StartPoint is disabled (maybe this is only for historical missions, it
hasn't been extensively tested).

The seven waypoints, in order are:
Start 1
Waypoint 1
Waypoint 2
Waypoint 3
Start 2
Start 3
Hyperspace

Unlike other platforms, there is no Briefing waypoint.  Instead, it is stored
in the briefing (BRF) file as a Coordinate Set.

Formation (enum)
Determines the flight formation, if there are multiple craft in the wave.

PlayerCraft determines which slot the player craft appears in.  0 for none, 1
for the first craft, 2 for the second, etc.  If multiple FGs have a PlayerCraft
set, the last assigned FG will be the actual group the player flies.

AISkill (enum) determines the AI skill level.  Higher skill levels shoot
faster, have a longer firing distance, wait for better warhead locks, and are
faster to adjust their aim and positioning.

Order (enum), OrderValue, TargetPrimary, TargetSecondary
These collectively define the mission orders.  OrderValue is a special case.
For boarding orders, it is interpreted as the docking time (in minutes)
required to complete the operation.  For all other orders, it is usually
interpreted as a throttle value.  Different orders will obey throttle in
different ways.  It is typically obeyed when patrolling or flying waypoints.
Primary and Secondary target FGs can be -1 for none.  Since having only two
targets is quite restrictive, most orders will "autotarget" certain craft types
in addition to their specific targets.  Autotargeting is based on opposite IFF
(Imperials attack Rebels, and vice versa).  Neutrals are ignored.

Markings
Indicates the colored markings used on certain fighters.  There are two values
in the XWI file.  It is unknown if the second marking is used at all.  In all
LEC missions, both markings are always equal.

Objective (enum)
Determines the mission goal of the flight group.

-- ObjectGroup --

Name, Cargo, SpecialCargo, SpecialCargoCraft
Identical to the FlightGroup data, but does not appear to have any relevance in
the mission.

CraftType (enum)
Same as FlightGroup, but should be limited to the object subset of CraftTypes.
Note: The existence of Training Platforms may crash the game if used in
missions outside of the Pilot Proving Ground.

IFF (enum)
Does not seem to have any relevance.  Objects are not color coded by IFF,
always appearing as white in game.  Mines are always hostile no matter what.

ObjectFormation (enum)
Holds various parameter values depending on object types.
For mines, this determines the formation.  Bits 1 (0x1) and 2 (0x2) will
produce a value of 0 to 3.  See ObjectFormation enum.
For destructible objects such as mines, satellites, probes, and nav buoy, the
mission goal is encoded in bits 3 (0x4) and 4 (0x8).  If neither bit is set,
there is no goal.  If Bit 3 (0x4) is set, the object must be destroyed.  If
Bit 4 (0x8) is set, the object must survive/be protected.
For training platform gates in the Pilot Proving Ground, this value is a
bitfield.  Bits 1 through 6 will indicate which guns are present on the
platform.  A value of 0x3F indicates all 6 guns are present.  The bits map to
different gun emplacements depending on which training platform is used.
A special exception for the first training platform (CraftType=58 (0x3A)),
which does not have guns.  Instead this value determines the SECONDS on the
mission clock.

NumberOfCraft 
Holds various parameter values depending on object types.
For mines, this determines how wide the minefield is.  Minefields are always a
square formation, centered over their starting point.  For example, a value of
3 will create a 3x3 grid of mines.
Determines the number of asteroids for asteroid objects.
All other objects appear to be limited to just one.
For Training Platforms with guns, a value of 2 or higher indicates the guns are
active and hostile.  Otherwise they will be visible, but inactive.
A special exception for the first training platform (CraftType=58 (0x3A)),
which does not have guns.  Instead this value determines the MINUTES on the
mission clock.

Yaw, Pitch and Roll values only work for Space Objects (mines, buoys, etc). The
following description differs from previous editors, so bear with me.
LucasArts, in their infinite wisdom, had the flight engine automatically add a
-90° (nose down) Pitch angle to Objects.

-- Briefing --

The briefing is a self-contained separate file (.BRF section).  As the name
implies, it only seems to affect the briefing.  It contains much redundant
information, duplicate fields that are present in the XWI file such as mission
header, FlightGroup, and ObjectGroup information, etc.  Despite having all that
information, it does not appear to impact the actual mission.  Nor does depend
on, or use any information from the XWI file.

The BRF file structure is heavily dynamic, as nearly every section is variable
length.

There is a short header defining how many CoordinateSet and IconSet are
present.

CoordinateSet are essentially waypoints.  Typical LEC missions have two
CoordinateSet, the first a duplicate of the XWI starting point, and the second
for the briefing map.  Waypoint units are identical to craft waypoints
(160 = 1 km).
Note: The starting point's Y axis is usually inverted from the XWI's Y axis.

IconSet holds the craft information for the icons displayed on the briefing
map.  This section shares much similarity to the FlightGroup and ObjectGroup in
the XWI file, but exists independently of them.  These can be considered as
Briefing-only FlightGroups.  They are sometimes identical to the XWI file, but
there is no guarantee.  The number of FlightGroups may differ between the XWI
and BRF files, as well as their ordering.
Note: While the XWI file does not have a CraftType for the B-Wing (Y-Wing with
a special status) the BRF file DOES have a specific icon for the B-Wing.

WindowUISettings is a unique section to the XWING briefing which determines the
coordinate viewports of each element on screen.  There are five elements:
Title text, caption text, Unused1, Unused2, and briefing map, in that order.
Each element has five SHORTs.  Four defining the rectangle coordinates of the
top, left, bottom, and right edges.  The final SHORT is a boolean that
determines whether the element is visible.

Unlike other platforms, the briefing is divided into Pages.  Each page is
either a "Map page" to render a briefing map, or a "Text page" to render text.

Note: The page is actually a WindowUISettings index that determines whether
the page renders map or text viewports, but the format described applies to
the convention commonly seen in LEC's own files.

The command listing itself I'll leave for the list definition, that'll also
have the variable listing as well. The first value is the duration of the
briefing itself in ticks.  XWING uses 0x8 ticks per second.

Each Event is marked by the briefing time (in ticks) and the EventType,
followed by 0-3 additional variables.  These variables are to be omitted if
they are not used for a given command.  Unlike other platforms, the events list
usually isn't terminated by an EndBriefing command.  Instead use EventsLength
to get the actual length.

EventsLength is the total number of SHORTs occupied in the Events array up to
and including the EndBriefing command, if present.

Following the briefing pages is the MissionHeader which contains redundant
header information from the XWI file.  Most notable is the Location property
indicating the Death Star Surface, which produces a different map background in
the briefing.

Then there is IconExtraData, which contains more redundant XWI information.
This does not appear to be used, and can be filled with zeroes.

The Tag and String arrays are not fixed sizes.  They have a minimum length of
64 bytes, which is the case of every length being zero.  If a Length is zero,
then the CHAR[] is omitted.  The Strings section is a special case.  For each
CHAR[] string, there is a BYTE[] array of equal length to the string.  This
array stores the highlight information of each character within the string:
1 for highlighting, 0 for none.

Each String should not exceed 1024 (0x400) bytes of total length.  Strings may
contain certain control codes which produce formatting effects in game.
These are:
'$'   Line break.
'\0'  (null terminator) Line break.  Recommended to use '$' instead.
\0\0  (two null terminators) guaranteed to end the string in game.
0x02  Begins highlighting.  Recommended to use the BYTE[] array instead.
0x01  Ends highlighting.
'>'   If the first character on a line, creates yellow center-alignment text.

XWING automatically generates word-wrapping.  The control codes 0x02, 0x01,
and '>' will highlight only until the end of the current line.

The BRF file does not require that strings contain null terminators.  However,
the actual size of the string should at least 2 bytes less than the maximum
(therefore 1022 bytes) so that the game's memory can accommodate at least two
null terminators and properly render the text without memory overflow issues.

The 0x02 and 0x01 highlighting codes were standard practice in TIE Fighter, but
they appear to work in X-wing as well.  LEC BRF files don't appear to use them
much, if at all.
