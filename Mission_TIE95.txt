This is going to be a very lengthy definition of the TIE95 mission file.  Due
to the size of the files we'll be dealing with, my structure display will vary
slightly, by adding offsets before values.  It's not a big deal with resource
files, but I doubt you'll want to count a few kilobytes to find a value :P

The file itself is made of up multiple sections, equatable to a single resource
in a LFD with multiple subheaders.  For the purpose of these file descriptions,
each section will will begin at '0', such that to find an offset in a later
section, you simply add the total length of the sections before it to get
there.  This is what I use in my personal notes, so this is what I am forcing
upon you.  I win.  I'll try to keep the mission design comments to a minimum,
but I promise nothing.

TIE95 Mission Overview

The mission files found in the, *gasp*, \MISSION directory have the .TIE file
extension and no required naming convention, just that the matching BATTLE LFD
has the filename spelled correctly to be able to play it. The LEC naming
convention for the files is simple; B #BATTLE_NUMBER# M #MISSION_NUMBER# 
#PLAYER_CRAFT# (F is TIE, B is Bomber, etc) #CREATOR# (M or W, last initial of
the mission designer). By no means do you have to follow this, I just put that
out there if you need to find a specific mission, or are just curious.

There are already a few editors out there for TIE missions, most notably TFW
(TIE Fighter Workshop). Anyone with a lot of spare time and a hex editor can
map out these values, and whadya know, I was bored :P

The .INV files are related to in-flight colors and are generated based on color
settings. The mission files starting with H are the Historical Missions found
in the Combat Chamber.

TIE95 Mission Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
BOOL	1	0=false, 1=true
BYTE	1	unsigned 8-bit
SBYTE	1	signed 8-bit, [-128, +127]
CHAR	1	ASCII character
SHORT	2	signed Int16
DWORD	4	signed Int32
STR(*)	*	null-terminated string, * is an integer length

NOTE: Any byte locations that are between defined values and are not explicitly
defined are deemed as Reserved(0), and have only been found to have zero
values. All unknowns have been discovered and named accordingly per the LEC
format spec, their previous TFW/YOGEME Unknown designation is listed next to
it. Some values are known to be editor only or have no effect in-game, others
may or may not be "active". Inactive values are named in paranethesis.
Rest assured you have everything here to piece together a mission file from
scratch, but please note offsets if creating read/write procedures.

TIE95 Mission Detail

Hopefully I named the variables descriptive enough for you that you can figure
out what they mean, but I'm going to delve into each section anyway. Section 5
and on will require a bit of explaining anyway. Supplementary definitions and
lists follow after the detail.

-- FileHeader --

PlatformID is a marker used to identify the mission file as belonging to
TIE95. Other platforms have different values in this place.

**NOTE** There is a legacy format where this value is not present. In-game,
this is handled as if the value is not < 0, then NumFGs is actually at 0x00.
There are other places in the format where this also has an effect, they'll be
marked with [LEGACY] notations.

The Num values are simply that, the number of FG/Message/Global sections that
are contained in the file, much like any other Length value in a resource file.
Global Goals can technically be something other than 3, and it will attempt to
read whatever quantity is there, but there's memory for 4, and the game will
always attempt to process 3. So it's better to treat it as Reserved(3).

BriefingOfficers is a value 01-03, and determines which officers will be
present in the room before you launch into a mission.
01	Both officers
02	Flight Officer
03	Secret Order
(No other values used, but evaluate to Both Officers)

RandomSeed is an initial value, for the most part it isn't important since the
game will update that regularly based on time anyway. The next slew of values
don't appear to have any function, even though they're part of the spec.

The next six strings are the messages you see after the given goals are
completed or failed. The array is really [3,2], two messages each for
PrimaryComplete, SecondaryComplete and PrimaryFailed in that order. The Delay
doesn't appear to be used in TIE.

Following that, we have the name of the extra IFFs. IFF1 and IFF2 are
hard-coded as Rebel and Imperial, respectively. If the IFF is hostile, then the
first character is '1' (0x31, not 01). IFF5 (Red) is always hostile, '1' not
necessary.

-- FlightGroup --

The first string is obvious. The second string, Pilot, isn't actually used. It
is a bookkeeping note for the editor. There's a few bookkeeping values in TIE,
but later platforms have a lot more. Working down, the next one worth
mentioning is the Special craft. If Random is selected, then the craft number
before it is ignored. Continuing to ObeyPlayerOrders. For TIE95, this is a
simple boolean value, but in later platforms this is renamed to simply "Radio"
and takes on additional functionality.

Formation is obvious, but I'll explain the next couple. FormationSpacing
defaults to 02 "Tight", which is a decent spacing for fighters and other small
craft. You may want to increase that for larger ships. Formation has no effect
on mines. They use the Status field instead. Possible values are:
0: Floor (X-Y plane)
1: Side (Y-Z plane)
2: Front (X-Z plane)
3: All overlap a single point. They'll destroy each other with friendly-fire.
Anything beyond repeats this sequence. There is no way to change the spacing.

GlobalGroup is a great way of grouping multiple FG primarily for order and
trigger use. Instead of listing out each flightgroup or craft type in an order
you can lump everything to a GG and use a single target. Also works with Goals.

NumberOfWaves is zero-indexed, so the number stored is actually the number of
additional waves after the inital starting group. PlayerCraft is one-indexed
with no player being a value of zero. You can only have one PlayerCraft 
active in a mission at any given time, otherwise both craft will be
unresponsive. TFW will only let you set one, but there are ways around this and
interesting tricks you can do with more than one.

Yaw, Pitch and Roll values only work for Space Objects (mines, buoys, etc). The
following description differs from previous editors, so bear with me.
LucasArts, in their infinite wisdom, had the flight engine automatically add a
-90° (nose down) Pitch angle to Objects. In XWA, this holds for all craft. We
don't have to worry about this with normal craft since the waypoints control
direction. TFW treats these values as Unknowns, I don't think TIE Edit can even
edit them. The values stored are angle(°)/360*256, so 90° is 0x40 (d64). Yaw is
evaluated first, then Pitch, then Roll.

The next couple values provide some intesting mechanics, but are hardly ever
used. The Permadeath mechanic is for multi-mission campaigns, and provide an
extra layer of realism. Sometimes, there are ways to destroy named craft in a
mission that you weren't really intended to; be it from luck, bad mission
design, or you're just that good. Then in the next mission that craft has been
glued back together like nothing happened. Permadeath prevents that. When
enabled, the number of ships destroyed with that ID is saved in the pilot file,
and is subtracted from available craft in future missions. For capital ships
it generally means they're just not present. For fighter groups, if you
destroy 4 of 6 in the first missions, only 2 will spawn in the next. Keep in
mind, triggers/goals that rely on them in later missions will treat them as if
they never spawned, so plan accordingly.

Now we're in the Arr/Dep section starting with Difficuly. In sentence form,
Triggers are "if Amount of VariableType Variable are Condition, then true". The
Arrival and Departure triggers are just that. The Alternate trigger is there
for if the originals can't be satisfied (mothership isn't in play). There's
also a special departure for after a craft as been captured. *Or* values
determine if one or both of the Triggers must fire to be true. The ArrivalDelay
works as expected, with the countdown starting after the Trigger has been
fired. The DepartureDelay works differently, though. That timer works from the
mission timer seen in your cockpit display. The flight group will leave when
the timer reaches the Delay value, or when the Trigger is fired, whichever
comes first. The AbortCondition applies only to individual craft, not the
entire flight group. When *ViaMothership is false, craft use hyperspace.

Orders, they're what make the world go 'round. Pick the Order from the list
and go from there. The Throttle value is simply expressed as
%Throttle = (value * 10). The Variables are controlled by the Order itself, as
different orders take different amounts for different reasons. Target and
TargetType are the same as Trigger.Variable and VariableType. Although there's
four Variables, in TIE no orders are known to use more than two.

Goals are for that specific flight group. The array is comprised of Primary,
Secondary, Fail, and Bonus, in that order. For BonusGoalPoints, the
stored value is expressed as (Points / 50), so 01 is 50pts, 02 is 100pts, etc.
Because the value is an SBYTE, this yields a point range of [-6400, +6350].
By the Force use these goals instead of Global Goals when possible. The Failed
goal does not function in TIE, and is ignored.

Waypoints are pretty simple, the array is X, Y, Z and Enabled in that order.
The values are expressed as (Coordinate * 160), such that a value of 0x50 is
0.50km, 0xA0 is 1.00km, etc. The Enable value just tells the application if it
needs to pay attention to it or not and is boolean, although it does occupy a
SHORT. If more than one StartPoint is enabled, the application will pick one to
use.

-- Backdrops --
Backdrops (stars, planets, etc) are special types of flight groups that use
some of the values differently.

The primary value here is Status, which becomes the Backdrop value. This
determines the graphic used. The majority of other values in the flight group
are ignored.

-- Message --

Another simple section; there is the message string, the triggers, a delay, and
the *Or* value. The EditorNote serves no purpose within the game itself, and is
merely there for bookkeeping use in the editor. The Delay value is evaluated to
(seconds / 5), such that 01 is 5s, 03 is 15s, etc.

The message string actually holds a second purpose, that is defining the color
of the message itself. The default message color is red, if the message starts
with '1' it is green, '2' is blue and '3' is purple. The number will not appear
when displayed in-game.

-- GlobalGoal --

When FG goals just won't cut it, that's what these are for. The array is
Primary, Secondary and Bonus. There's a bookkeeping note, a Delay between when
the triggers are completed and when it registers as complete, and a Version
value which I believe is unused.

-- Briefing --

Okay, we finally get to the briefing. The command listing itself I'll leave
for the list definition, that'll also have the variable listing as well. The
first value is the duration of the briefing itself in ticks. TIE uses 0xC
ticks per second.

Each Event is marked by the briefing time (in ticks) and the EventType,
followed by 0-4 additional variables. These variables are to be omitted if
they are not used for a given command. The last four active bytes in the Event
array is always 0F 27 22 00, which is the EndBriefing command at time 9999, and
usually isn't the last four bytes in the section (that would be a rather busy
briefing). The Event struct itself is something used here and in my code to
make it easier to parse, but in-game the array is simply a single short[0x190].

The next couple values don't matter in-game, as they'll be reset anyway in
memory. The CurrentTime value is what TIE uses to keep track of when it is so
it knows whether or not to keep processing events. The original LEC editor
would save it so work could resume right where they left off.

The CurrentEvent value (formerly StartLength) is also immediately reset in
memory, but traditionally is the number of SHORTs, Variables included, that
occur at Time=0, effectively the offset to the first event that needs to fire
when playback starts. The original belief for this value was a side effect of
the LEC editors processing events at T=0, thus assigning the next event offset.

EventsLength is the total number of SHORTs occupied in the Events array up to
and including the EndBriefing command. Though set by the original editors, it
appears to be completely ignored by the game. Tile is named per the XWA spec,
but also has no use.

The Tag and String arrays are not fixed sizes. They have a minimum length of
64 bytes, which is the case of every length being zero. If a Length is zero,
then the CHAR[] is naturally omitted. That's the real highlight right there.

Technical note: The briefing caption strings allow certain character codes.
0x00 for a newline, 0x02 to begin highlighting, 0x01 to end highlighting. A
single 0x00 will act as a newline, but two in a row [0x00 0x00] will be
considered a null terminator. The maximum space in game memory for a caption
string is 160 (0xA0) bytes and that must include the double [0x00 0x00] null
terminator. Excess length strings, or an improperly terminated string that
runs into another string may cause the game to crash.

Tag lengths are limited to a maximum of 40 (0x28), attempting to use more than
that will crash the game.

[LEGACY] Tag lengths are fixed 0x28, String lengths are fixed 0xA0.

-- PreMissionQuestion --

Similar to Tags and Strings, this has a dynamic size. Similarly, if Length is
zero, the following values are omitted. In reality, the Question and Answer are
part of the same string. If the Length is nonzero, then 0x0A is appended to the
Question. This is the line break that the application is searching for to
seperate the substrings, not the usual 00. The first five questions belong to
the Flight Officer, and the second five belong to the Secret Order Officer.
The array has a minimum byte length of 0x14.

Technical note: There are some character control codes, and also a length
limit.  See technical notes in PostMissionQuestion.

[LEGACY] Section does not exist.

-- PostMissionQuestion --

This is pretty much the same as PreMission, only with the added
QuestionCondition and QuestionType values. QuestionType can be 00-02.
00	None
01	Primary Goals
02	Secondary Goals
QuestionCondition has three known values, and I would guess more that are
undiscovered.
00	None
04	Successful
05	Failed
Again, the Length can be zero and thus ignoring the values following it, with a
minimum length of 0x14. 0x0A is still appended to Question to be used as the
seperator.

The 0xFF after the questions is the typical EOF flag, though it doesn't appear
to be truly necessary. I use it, can't hurt. That said, after the last Post
question TIE doesn't really care anymore and it closes the file.

Technical note: The total length of "data" for a mission question should not
exceed 1024 (0x400) bytes. Extending above this limit greatly increases
chances of crashing the game when loading the briefing or debriefing.  This
data includes the strings of both question and answer (and separator between
them), plus space for a null terminator when loaded into game memory (the
terminator is not present in the file itself). For PostMissionQuestion data,
the Condition and Type bytes both contribute toward this limit.  It is unknown
if the two-byte Length field also contributes, but in testing it doesn't
seem to be.

Answer text allows the use of character control codes 0x02 to begin
highlighting, 0x01 to end highlighting, or 0x0A for newline. There's also a
0x03 control code, which controls the facial expression of the officers while
they're speaking. The code is followed by the expression code, which is a
little different between the officer and secret order and they're roughly:
Officer:
01 normal
02 inqusitive
03 judging
04 angry
05 judging with angry blink
Secret Order:
01 normal
02 inquisitive, unblinking
03 inquisitive, unblinking
04 angry
05 inquisitive, unblinking

* Technical note: Approximately 75% systems, fighters and transports only.
This triggers when the cannon subsystem is disabled by ions or not installed.
Ships that do not have forward cannons don't possess a cannon subsystem,
therefore starships will abort instantly if given this trigger.
