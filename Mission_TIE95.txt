This is going to be a very lengthy definition of the TIE95 mission file.  Due
to the size of the files we'll be dealing with, my structure display will vary
slightly, by adding offsets before values.  It's not a big deal with resource
files, but I doubt you'll want to count a few kilobytes to find a value :P

The file itself is made of up multiple sections, equatable to a single resource
in a LFD with multiple subheaders.  For the purpose of these file descriptions,
each section will will begin at '0', such that to find an offset in a later
section, you simply add the total length of the sections before it to get
there.  This is what I use in my personal notes, so this is what I am forcing
upon you.  I win.  I'll try to keep the mission design comments to a minimum,
but I promise nothing.

TIE95 Mission Overview

The mission files found in the, *gasp*, \MISSION directory have the .TIE file
extension and no required naming convention, just that the matching BATTLE LFD
has the filename spelled correctly to be able to play it. The LEC naming
convention for the files is simple; B #BATTLE_NUMBER# M #MISSION_NUMBER# 
#PLAYER_CRAFT# (F is TIE, B is Bomber, etc) #CREATOR# (M or W, last initial of
the mission designer). By no means do you have to follow this, I just put that
out there if you need to find a specific mission, or are just curious.

There are already a few editors out there for TIE missions, most notably TFW
(TIE Fighter Workshop). Anyone with a lot of spare time and a hex editor can
map out these values, and whadya know, I was bored :P

I have no clue what the .INV files are there for, these seem to be generated
almost at random. The mission files starting with H are the Historical
Missions found in the Combat Chamber.

TIE95 Mission Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
BOOL	1	0=false, 1=true
BYTE	1	unsigned 8-bit
SBYTE	1	signed 8-bit, [-128, +127]
CHAR	1	ASCII character
SHORT	2	signed Int16
INT	4	signed Int32
STR(*)	*	null-terminated string, * is a decimal number

NOTE: Any byte locations that are between defined values and are not explicitly
defined are deemed as Reserved(0), and have only been found to have zero
values. Unknown bytes that have non-zero values have been called out in the
structure. Rest assured you have everything here to piece together a mission
file from scratch, but please note offsets if creating read/write procedures.

TIE95 Mission Detail

Hopefully I named the variables descriptive enough for you that you can figure
out what they mean, but I'm going to delve into each section anyway. Section 5
and on will require a bit of explaining anyway. Supplementary definitions and
lists follow after the detail.

-- FileHeader --

The first SHORT is a marker used to identify the mission file as belonging to
TIE95. Other platforms have different markers in this place, but it is
unknown whether or not the application actually checks this value to determine
if the file is valid or not.

The two Num values are simply that, the number of FG and Message sections that
are contained in the file, much like any other Length value in a resource file.

BriefingOfficers is a value 01-03, and determines which officers will be
present in the room before you launch into a mission.
01	Both officers
02	Flight Officer
03	Secret Order
(No other values used, but evaluate to Both Officers)

The next six strings are the messages you see after the given goals are
completed or failed. The array is really [3,2], two messages each for
PrimaryComplete, SecondaryComplete and PrimaryFailed in that order. Following
that, we have the name of the extra IFFs. IFF1 and IFF2 are hard-coded as Rebel
and Imperial, respectively. If the IFF is hostile, then the first character is
1 (hex value 31, not 01). In one occassion, char of 4 has been seen (hex 34).

-- FlightGroup --

The first string is obvious. The second string, Pilot, isn't actually used. It
appears to be just a bookkeeping note for the editor. Third is obvious again,
as is the fourth. I'm going to continue to skim through this section here, down
to ObeyPlayerOrders. For TIE95, this is a simple boolean value, but in later
platforms this is renamed to simply "Radio" and takes on additional
functionality.

Formation is obvious, but I'll explain the next couple. FormationSpacing
defaults to 02, which is a decent spacing for fighters and other small craft.
You may want to increase that for larger ships. GlobalGroup is a great way of
grouping (gasp) craft primarily for order and trigger use. Instead of listing
out each flightgroup or craft type in an order you can lump everything to a GG
and use a single target. LeaderSpacing is how far ahead of the rest of the
flight group the flight leader is. Having a flight leader way out front can
absorb fire and let the rest of the group fire salvos before being attacked
themselves.  

Formation has no effect on mines. They use the Status field instead. Possible
values are:
0: Floor (X-Y plane)
1: Side (Y-Z plane)
2: Front (X-Z plane)
3: All overlap a single point. They'll destroy each other with friendly-fire.
Anything beyond repeats this sequence. There is no way to change the spacing.

NumberOfWaves is zero-indexed, so the number stored is actually the number of
additional waves after the inital starting group. PlayerCraft is one-indexed
with no player being a value of zero. You can only have one PlayerCraft 
active in a mission at any given time, otherwise both craft will be
unresponsive. TFW will only let you set one, but there are ways around this and
interesting tricks you can do with more than one.

Yaw, Pitch and Roll values only work for Space Objects (mines, buoys, etc). The
following description differs from previous editors, so bear with me.
LucasArts, in their infinite wisdom, had the flight engine automatically add a
-90° (nose down) Pitch angle to Objects. In XWA, this holds for all craft. We
don't have to worry about this with normal craft since the waypoints control
direction. TFW treats these values as Unknowns, I don't think TIE Edit can even
edit them. The values stored are angle(°)/360*256, so 90° is 0x40 (d64). Yaw is
evaluated first, then Pitch, then Roll.

Another obvious value, then the Arrival Trigger. In sentence form, Triggers
are "if Amount of VariableType Variable are Condition, then true". The Arrival
and Departure triggers are just that. The Alternate triggers are there for if
the originals can't be satisfied (mothership isn't in play). *Or* values
determine if one or both of the Triggers must fire to be true. The ArrivalDelay
works as expected, with the countdown starting after the Trigger has been
fired. The DepartureDelay works differently, though. That timer works from the
mission timer seen in your cockpit display. The flight group will leave when
the timer reaches the Delay value, or when the Trigger is fired, whichever
comes first. The AbortCondition applies only to individual craft, not the
entire flight group. When *ViaMothership is false, craft use hyperspace.

Orders, they're what make the world go 'round. Pick the Order from the list
and go from there. The Throttle value is simply expressed as
%Throttle = (value * 10). The Variables are controlled by the Order itself, as
different orders take different amounts for different reasons. Target and
TargetType are the same as Trigger.Variable and VariableType.

Goals are for that specific flight group. The array is comprised of Primary,
Secondary, Unused, and Bonus, in that order. For BonusGoalPoints, the
stored value is expressed as (Points / 50), so 01 is 50pts, 02 is 100pts, etc.
Because the value is an SBYTE, this yields a point range of [-6400, +6350].
By the Force use these goals instead of Global Goals when possible.

Waypoints are pretty simple, the array is X, Y, Z and Enabled in that order.
The values are expressed as (Coordinate * 160), such that a value of 0x50 is
0.50km, 0xA0 is 1.00km, etc. The Enable value just tells the application if it
needs to pay attention to it or not and is boolean, although it does occupy a
SHORT. If more than one StartPoint is enabled, the application will pick one to
use. Thus ends this section.

-- Backdrops --
Backdrops (stars, planets, etc) are special types of flight groups. Value
definitions change for these purposes, which will be laid out here.

The primary value here is Status, which becomes the Backdrop value. This
determines the graphic used. The majority of other values are ignored.

-- Message --

Another simple section; there is the message string, the triggers, a delay, and
the *Or* value. The EditorNote serves no purpose within the game itself, and is
merely there for bookkeeping use in the editor. The Delay value is evaluated to
(seconds / 5), such that 01 is 5s, 03 is 15s, etc.

The message string actually holds a second purpose, that is defining the color
of the message itself. The default message color is red, if the message starts
with '1' it is green, '2' is blue and '3' is purple. The number will not appear
when displayed in-game.

-- GlobalGoal --

When FG goals just won't cut it, that's what these are for. The mysterious
Secret goal is missing, and there's a lot of dead space, but what is there is
self-explanatory by now. Array is Primary, Secondary and Bonus.

-- Briefing --

Okay, we finally get to the briefing. The command listing itself I'll leave
for the list definition, that'll also have the variable listing as well. The
first value is the duration of the briefing itself in ticks. TIE uses 0xC
ticks per second.

Each Event is marked by the briefing time (in ticks) and the EventType,
followed by 0-4 additional variables. These variables are to be omitted if
they are not used for a given command. The last four active bytes in the Event
array is always 0F 27 22 00, which is the EndBriefing command at time 9999, and
usually isn't the last four bytes in the section (that would be a rather busy
briefing).

The CurrentTime value is actually ignored from the file, as it's reset to zero
every time the briefing restarts anyway, and is what TIE uses to keep track of
where it is.

The StartsLength value is the number of SHORTs, Variables included, that occur
at Time=0. EventsLength is the total number of SHORTs occupied in the Events
array up to and including the EndBriefing command.

The Tag and String arrays are not fixed sizes. They have a minimum length of
64 bytes, which is the case of every length being zero. If a Length is zero,
then the CHAR[] is omitted. That's the real highlight right there.

Technical note: The briefing caption strings allow certain character codes.
0x00 for a newline, 0x02 to begin highlighting, 0x01 to end highlighting.  A
single 0x00 will act as a newline, but two in a row [0x00 0x00] will be
considered a null terminator.  The maximum space in game memory for a caption
string is 160 (0xA0) bytes and that must include the double [0x00 0x00] null
terminator.  Excess length strings, or an improperly terminated string that
runs into another string may cause the game to crash.

Attempting to render a text tag with a string character length >= 40 will crash
the game.

-- PreMissionQuestion --

Similar to Tags and Strings, this has a dynamic size. Similarly, if Length is
zero, the following values are omitted. In reality, the Question and Answer are
part of the same string. If the Length is nonzero, then 0x0A is appended to the
Question. This is the line break that the application is searching for to
seperate the substrings, not the usual 00. The first five questions belong to
the Flight Officer, and the second five belong to the Secret Order Officer.
The array has a minimum byte length of 0x14.

Technical note: There are some character control codes, and also a length
limit.  See technical notes in PostMissionQuestion.

-- PostMissionQuestion --

This is pretty much the same as PreMission, only with the added
QuestionCondition and QuestionType values. QuestionType can be 00-02.
00	None
01	Primary Goals
02	Secondary Goals
QuestionCondition has three known values, and I would guess more that are
undiscovered.
00	None
04	Successful
05	Failed
Again, the Length can be zero and thus ignoring the values following it, with a
minimum length of 0x14. 0x0A is still appended to Question to be used as the
seperator.

The 0xFF after the questions might be required as a EOF flag, might not, but I
use it for my write code. Can't hurt. That said, after the last Post question
is done I really don't think TIE cares anymore, since I've put other values
before the FF and I've never had troubles with running missions like that.

Technical note: The total length of "data" for a mission question should not
exceed 1024 (0x400) bytes.  Extending above this limit greatly increases
chances of crashing the game when loading the briefing or debriefing.  This
data includes the strings of both question and answer (and separator between
them), plus space for a null terminator when loaded into game memory (the
terminator is not present in the file itself).  For PostMissionQuestion data,
the Condition and Type bytes both contribute toward this limit.  It is unknown
if the two-byte Length field also contributes, but in testing it doesn't
seem to be.

Answer text allows the use of character control codes 0x02 to begin
highlighting, 0x01 to end highlighting, or 0x0A for newline.

There you have it, the TIE95 Mission file format. Enjoy :P

* Technical note: The system percent isn't used, but is only an estimate.
This actually triggers when the cannon subsystem has been disabled with ions
(mag pulse doesn't count).  Ion shots work by knocking out individual subsystem
components in sequence (out of 10 possible subsystems that can be equipped),
and cannons are about the third subsystem to go.  Ships that do not have
forward cannons (typically anything that isn't a fighter or transport) don't
possess a cannon subsystem, therefore starships will abort instantly if given
this trigger.
